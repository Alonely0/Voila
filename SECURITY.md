# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are pushed directly to the latest version, just because I can't modify whatever already published on crates.io, following github's conventions, here is a table:

| Version      | Supported          |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| Latest       | :white_check_mark: |
| Not latest   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Open up an issue with the error label, and I'll fix that ASAP.
